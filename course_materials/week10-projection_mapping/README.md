Day 1: Examples, basics, learning the medium
--------------------------------------------

**Background**

Examples

 - https://vimeo.com/43385747 (Dane Luttik - Projection Mapping short documentary) 
 - https://vimeo.com/85212054 (AntiVJ - The Ark)
 - Intricacies of broken surfaces
 - Audio/visual show
 - Pure aesthetic
 - (shape fitting)
 - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KToDmJbEE7Y (Masaru Ozaki - Chair)
 - (shape fitting)
 - Exploring form, gracefully
 - Positions the form as a landscape - as a panned shot in a film moving across rolling hills

 - “Natural” augmentation
 - Lives as a video
 - (tracing)
 - http://www.bioluminescent-forest.com/ (documentation)
 - inspiration, preparation, production
 - http://www.bioluminescent-forest.com/behind-the-scenes/
 - https://vimeo.com/18888136 (1024 Architecture - Perspective Lyrique)
 - Explore shadows
 - Interactivity
 - Spectacle
 - (digital overlay)
 - https://vimeo.com/113000956 (Emmy Curl - Come Closer)
 - Illusory
 - Layered
 - (digital overlay)

**Basics approaches**

 - Shape fitting
 - Tracing
 - Digital overlay
 - Fill vs Mask

**Challenge**

 - Get to know the projector
 - Walk around with it
 - Project on different surface
 - Explore light in different colors on different materials
 - Mess with focus
 - Move close and far from different surfaces
 - Take note of focus, reflection, color/material mixing, skew, brightness
 - Think about sounds that complement the visuals you are seeing

**Quad Mapping**

Why?
 
 - Simple
 - Map basic shapes
 - Think of it as digital keystoning
 - Many tools and libraries

Processing

 - http://keystonep5.sourceforge.net/ (Simple Processing library for Quad Mapping)
 - Texture mapping
 - Masking

Javascript

 - https://github.com/glowbox/maptasticjs (Simple JavaScript library for Quad Mapping)
 - Run local server with Node (if using external content)
 - Texture mapping
 - Masking




Day 2: Quads and meshes
-----------------------

**Challenge**

 - Experiment with quad mapping
 - Either set up a collection of objects, or use an existing “scene” you see
 - Setup your projector
 - Choose a tool (we’ve covered Processing and Javascript)
 - Start mapping using multiple quads for multiple shapes or a combination for single complex shapes
 - Experiment with color, patterns, animations, and video
 - *Bonus*: include some form of interaction
   - Mouse, keyboard, audio, external data

**Mesh Mapping (3d projection mapping)**

Examples

 - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZHef-hAvOM (The Light Factory - Projection Mapping on Bottle)

Why

 - Complex geometries
 - Overlay interior information, not just boundary information
 - Complex geometries could be made with the creation of multiple Quads, but then each quad is independent, mesh mapping allows you to overlay (texture render) the entire complex geometry

How

 - Build a 3d model, save as OBJ, import to Processing, do things with the mesh faces
 - This will be a live tutorial





Day 3 - Build your own
----------------------

**Premium tools**

 - vvvv
 - MadMapper
 - Touch Designer
 - DynaMapper for iPad
 - TorsionBlend
 - http://projection-mapping.org/tag/projection-mapping-software/ (good list of common and new software products)

**Challenge**

 - Develop a concept, or identify a precedent work, and start building your own work in the theatre
 - Collaboration is highly encouraged
 - Decide on a tool (or tools) and the approach (quads, mesh, or a combination)
 - Think hard about what the concept is.  Is it a story?  Is it an interactive spectacle? Is it augmenting the theatre space in a dynamic way?  What is it you are doing, and why?
 - Give yourself (or the group) enough time for content creation, modeling, calibration, and sequencing (of the content)
